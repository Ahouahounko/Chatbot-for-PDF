## Overview

In this episode, I guide you through the creation of a chatbotðŸ¤–ðŸ’¬ capable of exchanging intelligently with PDF files, via the use of ChatGPT, LangChain, and Streamlit. We'll build an application that lets you ask questions about a PDF document and get answers directly from an LLM (Large Language Model), like OpenAI's GPT 3.5.
The app building follows the workflow designed on the picture below.
